Before compiling, you require an APPID and an APPCODE from HERE Geocoder Autocomplete API: https://developer.here.com/documentation/geocoder-autocomplete/topics/what-is.html.
After obtaining those variables, create a file called gradle.properties in the root of this project and add the variables hereAppId and hereAppCode like such:
```
hereAppId="aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
hereAppCode="bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
```
